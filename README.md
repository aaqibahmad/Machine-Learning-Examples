# Hello
We all can see Smarter, Advanced Systems all around us and it has dwelled into our daily life so much that we dont even recognise their presence in the backdrops of various Apps, Websites, Machines etc. All those systems are a kind of a computer which eventually is backed by various advance techniques to complete its desired task. One such technique is Machine Learning.

### Machine Learning 
When it comes to the definition of Machine Learning, we can say that it is the science where we allow the computers to learn and give them same kinds of acts as we humans do. They are improved over time by learning just as we do in an automatic way. Just like us, to improve we need broader collection data to analyse and improve, we feed them data and information as well as real world interactions.

### This repo will contain popular topics of my Machine Learning Lab with Examples for each of them. Few of them are pointed out as follows:
- (ML_LAB_01) Starting Data Analyis, Reading Data and Simple Visualizations
- (ML_LAB_02) Supervised Learning :
  - Demonstrate Naive Bayes Classifier for nominal Data.
  - Demonstrate Naive Bayes Classifier for numeric Data.
  - Demonstrate error using any three metrics and two plots.
- (ML_LAB_03) Demonstrate K Means Algorithm, include the following components : 
  - At least one plot to visualize the results. 
  - Elbow method for choosing optimum number of clusters.
  - At least one metric for the evaluation of the quality of obtained clusters.
- (ML_LAB_05) Demonstrate PCA for dimensionality reduction for image data with :
  - Demonstrate application of the reduced data for visualization.
  - Demonstrate the process using number of components and percentage of variance as criteria for obtaining the reduced dataset.
