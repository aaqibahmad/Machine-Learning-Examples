# Hello
We all can see Smarter, Advanced Systems all around us and it has dwelled into our daily life so much that we dont even recognise their presence in the backdrops of various Apps, Websites, Machines etc. All those systems are a kind of a computer which eventually is backed by various advance techniques to complete its desired task. One such technique is Machine Learning.

### Machine Learning 
When it comes to the definition of Machine Learning, we can say that it is the science where we allow the computers to learn and give them same kinds of acts as we humans do. They are improved over time by learning just as we do in an automatic way. Just like us, to improve we need broader collection data to analyse and improve, we feed them data and information as well as real world interactions.
